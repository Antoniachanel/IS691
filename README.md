Data Gathering
Data Gathering
I plan to utilize Covid 19 data to conduct an analysis. This data can be obtained through Alex the Anaylst and https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.  
Note - This is public data that you can use to explore how Covid 19 has affected different countries and their population. 
Concerned Source Data
1.	Data Timeframe: September 15th - November 17th 
2.	Source Data Description and Structure:
i.	The two datasets are organized into individual .xsls files. 
ii.	These files share common fields relevant to our analysis.
3.	After my initial examination, we can confidently assert that the source data is Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited.
Tool Selection for Analysis
1.	Tool for Data Cleaning: Excel 
a.	I chose Excel for this task because the dataset will be split into two tables, Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations.
2.	Tool for Data Exploration: SSMS 19
a.	 exceeded 5.8 million rows, making it impractical to manage with Excel (which is typically suitable for datasets of less than 1 million rows). SQL's capacity to handle large volumes of data makes it the preferred choice for data wrangling.
3.	Tool for Analysis and Visualization: Tableau
a.	While there are several tools available for data visualization, including Excel and Power BI, our selection of Tableau is deliberate. Tableau offers dynamic capabilities and a diverse range of visualization options, making it the ideal choice for our analytical and visualization needs.
Data Loading
1.	File Naming Convention: Files are named in the format of CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv .
