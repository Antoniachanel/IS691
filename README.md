Project Introduction

Business Needs 

i.	What percentage of the population got Covid?

ii.	What is the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in the United States.

iii.	What percentage of the population got Covid in the United States.

iv.	Display Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to its Population.

v.	Display Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population

Data Gathering

I plan to utilize Covid 19 data to conduct an analysis. This data can be obtained through Alex the Anaylst and https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.  

Note - This is public data that you can use to explore how Covid 19 has affected different countries and their population. 

Concerned Source Data

1.	Data Timeframe: October 24th - November 17th 

2.	Source Data Description and Structure:

i.	The two datasets are organized into individual .csv files. 

ii.	These files share common fields relevant to our analysis.

3.	After my initial examination, we can confidently assert that the source data is Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited.


Tool Selection for Analysis

1.	Tool for Data Cleaning: Excel 

a.	I chose Excel for this task because the dataset will be split into two tables, Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations.

2.	Tool for Data Exploration: SSMS 19

a.	Exceeding to over 80 thousand rows, I want use a SQL database to explore the dataset and gain insight on several different aspects of COVID 19 from 2020-2021.

3.	Tool for Analysis and Visualization: Tableau

a.	While there are several tools available for data visualization, including Excel and Power BI, our selection of Tableau is deliberate. Tableau offers dynamic capabilities and a diverse range of visualization options, making it the ideal choice for our analytical and visualization needs.

Data Loading

1.	File Naming Convention: Files are named in the format of CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv .
